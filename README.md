Light program that gives surf information for spots within Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara (since these are the only places I surf).
This site is powered by:
* [Spitcast API](http://www.spitcast.com/)
* [Weather API](https://www.wunderground.com/)
* [SunCalc Library](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc)

I may eventually implement a search function to access all of the Spitcast API (stay tuned!)
